Cover the bowl with a plate or cloth, and allow the berries to soak at normal room temperature overnight or for about 12 hours. The berries will soak up a considerable amount of water. Drain the berries in a colander, cover the colander with a plate to prevent the berries from drying out, and set it in a place away from light and where the sun won^^t shine on it.  Rinse the berries about 3 times a day, and they will soon begin to sprout. In a couple of days the sprouts will reach their optimum length of about l/4 inch. Growth depends on moisture and temperature so be patient.**Grind in a food mill or in a food processor.**After grinding, dump the mushed up grain onto a clean work surface. Squeeze and knead the grain for about 10 minutes, and then form up 2 small round, hearth-style loaves with your hands.

Cover the loaves with cloches, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Then turn the oven down to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and bake for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes more. Allow the breads to cool thoroughly on cooling racks for several hours, and then, because of the high moisture content, store in the refrigerator. For best results, slice this bread thinly, or break with hands**^",7106,https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/1009396.jpg

Using fingertips, rub fat into flour, working it until you have created a coarse meal with a few pea-size particles of fat.**Empty crumbs onto a cool surface.  Form mixture into a mound.  Make a 4 to 5 inch well in center of the mound.  Combine egg and vanilla and pour mixture into the well.  Using a fork, draw crumbs into egg mixture, about 1 - 2 tablespoons at a time.  When all crumbs are added, toss mixture a few times with a pastry blender to form large clumps, then scrape into a mound.**Using the heel of your hand, push 2 - 3 tablespoons of the dough at a time, outward in 6 to 8 inch sweeps.  This will blend fat and flour and give crust a delicate texture.  If your hand becomes sticky, flour it as needed.  Repeat process until all dough has been worked.  Gather dough into a mound again.

Dust disk lightly with flour, score with side of your hand, cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate for 20 minutes before shaping.  DO NOT LET DOUGH BECOME TOO HARD or it will be difficult to roll.  If this happens, let pastry soften at room temperature.**Roll out to 1/8 inch thickness.  After dough has been rolled, position rolling pin 4 inches from top of the pastry.  Lift dough over top of rolling pin and gently roll dough toward you.  Lift pastry up. Make sure you keep a finger pressed against barrel of rolling pin to keep it from slipping.  Position pastry, leaving about 1 1/2 inches of dough hanging over edge of pan on side closest to you. Then unroll pastry over an ungreased tart pan, moving pin away from you.  Immediately lift overhang into pan to prevent sharp edge of the pan from cutting dough.**Working a small portion of the dough at a time, mold it into crease of the pan.  Trim excess pastry from top edge of pan.  Chill pastry in refrigerator or freezer for up to 30 minutes.  Tear an 18 inch square of  tin foil.  Make a buttered circle in center of foil 2 inches larger than size of pan.  Place foil buttered side down, centering it into the baking pan.  Using your hand, press foil flush against the sides.**Heat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Position shelf in lower third of oven.  Fill pan with enough dried beans or baking nuggets to just cover surface of pan. DO NOT OVERFILL.  Bake pastry shell on a shallow pan with sides.

Continue to bake crust for 3 to 5 minutes or until it is golden.  If bottom of pastry shell puffs up, tap it gently with bottom of a fork to expel the air.
