# Khana Khojana

Food startups are the new trend in Nepal. In real world, food and hospitality industries are growing day by day. With an idea of creating an innovative food and recipe web application KHANA KHOJANA was born. This project will be an interactive web application which will provide the user a platform where they can find new recipes based on the ingredients they already have in their kitchen. It will also help the users to find new restaurants, cafes and food hubs according to their preferences and will also allow people to recommend various new and exciting places after they login in our web application. For other general purposes like finding a new restaurant and getting a new recipe people will just have to visit the site. All it will require is access to internet and then everyone will be able to find any recipes that would like to cook and they would also find restaurants of their choice. Hence it justifies the name of the web application as it will be all about finding new recipes to cook and exciting places to eat.
